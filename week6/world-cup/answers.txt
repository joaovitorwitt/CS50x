Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

When we have a large number of simulations, after 100000, the running time increases

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would say after 100000 simulations, that way we are able to visualize the percentage in a more precise way.
Taking for instance a coin toss, it is a 50/50 game, but lets say that in the first 5 tosses the coin landed on heads 4 times and on tails 1 time.
Someone might say that is a 80/20 game. But if we keep playing for a large number of rounds we will see that the numbers will start to line up.
